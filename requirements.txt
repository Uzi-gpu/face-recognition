# NOTE: dlib and face_recognition require CMake on Windows
# For Windows users without build tools:
# 1. Download pre-compiled dlib wheel from:
#    https://github.com/sachadee/Dlib
# 2. Install with: pip install dlib-19.22.0-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl
# 3. Then: pip install face-recognition

# Alternative: Use OpenCV DNN (included above) for face detection/recognition
# Notebooks 01, 02, 04, 05 will work without dlib
